# Arsha
This project was made with the purpose of testing my Web Development skills on recreating a design. However, the design itself wasn't made by me, but so by <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/arsha-free-bootstrap-html-template-corporate/#download-template">them</a>

## Why React?
THe reason for react being used on this project is because how easy is to write modularized HTML/CSS/Code and how you can reuse code in different parts of the website. There is also the default advantages of react (even though they not being useful on this project since its just a simple landing page, actually maybe it could be even better if it were made using another tech, but i already knew react and it was an opportunity to learn more about it :D)

## Credits
As I mentioned in the first topic of this README, the only part of this project that were designed by me was the code, anything else were found in google or taken from the website mentioned. The purpose of this project is to test how well i can make a website logic (CSS styles, HTML and Js).
